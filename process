Creating Noun lists:

1. Get IIT-B Parallel Corpus
2. Process both sides through UDPipe
3. Extract all nouns, with their UD_Feats data, especially the 'Gender' part, if available for both the docs.
4. Make sure the two noun lists, with their features are aligned properly though.

Filtering Noun lists:

5. Start with creating a dict of list of the words in the target language with their projection on the source side.
6. Remove the entry from both lists, if the word has entry for both male and female equivalents.
7. Count the number of elements remaining and also, the number of entries in the either bin.

Elimination criterion:

Start with the alignments and then we can remove the following from the list of the nouns-

1. No aiignment found.
2. Direct transliterations (eg- report रिपोर्ट). Check somehow? Happens after creating alignments though.
3. In case of a token being split (eg- Don't => Don ' t), stop considering all of them, else 't' from before will have as many as 10,000+ occurences, biasing the list very heavily.
    Do this before or after though?
