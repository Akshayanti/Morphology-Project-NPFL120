Creating Noun lists:

1. Get IIT-B Parallel Corpus
2. Process both sides through UDPipe
3. Extract all nouns, with their UD_Feats data, especially the 'Gender' part, if available for both the docs.
4. Make sure the two noun lists, with their features are aligned properly though.

Filtering Noun lists:

5. Start with creating a dict of list of the words in the target language with their projection on the source side.
6. Remove the entry from both lists, if the word has entry for both male and female equivalents.
7. Count the number of elements remaining and also, the number of entries in the either bin.
